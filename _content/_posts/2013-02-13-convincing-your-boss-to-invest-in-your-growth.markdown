<em>Apologies for the technical difficulties! I lost internet at the 30 minute
mark so our ending is a little weak. We'll work on that in future episodes!</em>

### Some Pro-tips
* Find out who your boss is and what they love
* Sell what they would get out of it. They'll be spending a lot of time and
  money and want to know what's in it for them.
* If you have an employer and they're not interested in growing you you should
  maybe quit.
* Not everyone can quit their job, so what do they do?

### Culture
* Culture is imporant, but before you can create the culture you have to
  convince them it's a good idea. (Note: It's hard to change the culture)
* You can't change the culture without changing the behavior at the top.
* See if they can host a meetup, that will get more people around talking about
  learning and growth
* Have a link share or book club! Go to coffee with the other people who care
  about their growth!
* Make it part of your salary negotiation. This much money per year on growth
  and this many days.

### The Employee/Employer Dynamic
* Phrase it in the employers interest. I.e. If you give a talk at a conference
  that's good PR and good for hiring!
* Recognize what you're actually asking. You're not asking for a book or a free
  lunch. It's you wanting more for your relationship between you and your
  employer to be more than just dollars for time.
* If we get better, we will produce more value.
* Management can tend to view talent as a commodity. 
* Bigger businesses tend to be dollars and cents, smaller businesses tend to be
  more about the relationship between boss/employee

### Retention
* Being afraid of losing employees after training is paranoia.
* Employees are more likely to stay due to loyalty than for money.
* Groupon discovered that not providing enough opportunities for growth caused
  people to leave. When a company doesn't continue to invest in growing their
  talent that's where they lose the talent.

### Demonstrate Your Passion
* Over lunch having a book club or watching a conference topic is a great way to
* demonstrate how much you care about this and how much it helps.


### Grow In Practical Areas
* Growth isn't always about learning a new shiney. It can also be about being
  better with the tools you use today.
* Training focused on the tools you use is very very powerful.
* Someone who already works at your company can be great for growing talent. It
  doesn't need to be an expensive outside trainer or a conference!
* Presenting and sharing information is a great way to prep  for management and
  builds soft skills!
