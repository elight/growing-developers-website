### The Hallway Track
The hallway track is when you spend time outside of talks, meeting and talking
with other people instead of attending a specific session.

[Matt Groves](https://twitter.com/mgroves/status/305815472195137536): talk to
people you've never met before, talk to people who use different tools/languages
than you

Talking in the hallway while sessions are in progress can be less intimidating
that trying to make onversation when there's a rush of people around

If you're intimidated by lots of people, find someone you know and pal around
with them!

If you're more extroverted you can try to talk to everyone you can! It's a great
way to meet people!

Get twitter handles and follow them right there so you start building a
relationship.

You may find you get more out of the hallway track than talks, especially if
you have a lot of experiences under your belt.

If you're shy, having a conversation rolodex can be useful; a simple set of 5
topics that most people at the conference may find interesting.

If talks are recorded, the hallway track is even better because you can still
listen to the talks later!

It's often easier to retain knowledge that you get from a conversation

You can be strategic about the people you talk to. Find the person who wrote your favorite library.

[Christopher Webber](https://twitter.com/cwebber/status/305817742055964672) -
Reach out to and meet those people that you admire in the community.

Find people who are sitting by themselves and ask them to join your conversation/go out to lunch

[Carina C Zona](https://twitter.com/cczona/status/305823637510959104) - Be brave
about starting conversations, entering conversations, and asking questions. Listen
boldly. Hallway track is all.

### Open Spaces
[Open
spaces](http://transitionculture.org/2008/03/21/12-tools-for-transition-no10-how-to-run-an-open-space-event/)
are emergent conference tracks where participants put together the topics and
then guide the discussions.

Open spaces have 4 rules:

1. Whoever comes are the right people
2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
3. Whenever it starts is the right time.
4. When it's over, it's over.

Open Spaces have 1 law: "If you are neither learning nor contributing, use your
feet and go somewhere else."

Joining one is easy, just sit down at one that sounds interesting!

Submit a topic that you really like or are excited about

Open spaces can have interesting, diverse topics! For instance, Ashe now knows
how to build a nuclear reactor! (DANGER! DANGER!)

### Choosing Talks

Most conference talks are introductions to topics; even if they label them as
advanced :(

If you have two equally interesting topis, pick the talk that you're not
experienced in; as it'll provide more new knowledge

### Stay Healthy!

[Tracy Harms](https://twitter.com/kaleidic/status/305821778377338880): Arrive
rested and get adequate sleep during it.

Don't go out every night. Bring fresh food. Drink lots of water!

Know your limits for alcohol! Sometimes you lose out on great talks or
hallway-talk because you partied too hardy.


### Respect The Speakers

There's nothing worse than being the first speaker on the second day! You feel sad :(

Remember to balance between getting stuff out of the conference for you and using the time/money your employer gave you

### Lightning talks
Sets of ~5 minute talks over a regular session. 

Lots of different ideas.

Sometimes lightning talks are fun because the person is hilarious; i.e. [Shibuya
Rubyist Lunch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5zBVyWsc_Q) and
[Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

Don't skip out on talks/spending time with people because you want to give a
lightning talk. Prep it before the conference!

### Hacking at conferences

Sometimes you want to avoid hacking at conferences. It often takes a few hours
to do something useful.

Don't bring your laptop to a conference. You pay more attention! You talk to
more people. You don't have to carry around a laptop!

If you want to hack, you can always find someone who has a machine and pair with the,
