description: We've all been there. We've been asked to do the impossible, or
             work with the impossible, or finish before anything is possible. In this
             episode, we talk about how to make the most out of those situations!

### How do you identify a bad project?
Low Frequency/Low Bandwidth/Top-down Communication

If you're communicating too much you may be missing some expectations that are
set up.

A project is usually bad not because of the tech, but because of the team
doesn't communicate well. Projects are people!

with Joe O'Brian is awesome about this:

How to improve communication depends on your influence.

### How do you survive?
Commiseration! Find the other miserable people. It doesn't make you happy but at
least you're not lonely.

Find someone who worked there before

Look for grassroots movements

Be careful about the venting spiral! Take action from your pain!

Take time away

### How do you thrive?

Pain builds character. Pain is experience. It's a good teacher. We tend to learn
more from negative than positive experiences; or at least they better reinforce
information

Bad projects push me to get more done faster. I want to get it over with.

Learning what you don't want helps you set yourself up for success in the
future. Thanks

Bad projects are great ways to run

Give opportunities to course correct. Some bad projects can be saved.

If you think a project is a runaway train we're removing our own responsibility.

### What about the code?
Do a small change and build upon it

Leave messages for the future! [Thanks

Give your project-ancestors the benefit of the doubt. Try to understand the
context.

Put important technical debt payoffs into the project management system. It
tells you how big the pile is.

You don't want to rewrite it.  Why?

* You don't want your feature list to be at a standstill
* The rewrite is spending money without seeing a benefit
* Few projects actually know all their requirements! Reverse engineering is a
  nightmare.

Write Characterization Tests: Describe the bug, treat it as an acceptance test.

Understand the skill level of the rest of the team! Some people may be silently
suffering :(. Be willing to talk about that.

Try to avoid writing clever code. Extract it and isolate it.

### Remember: If you don't have time to think, that's the time you need to think.
