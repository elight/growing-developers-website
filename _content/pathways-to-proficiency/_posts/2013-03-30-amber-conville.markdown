#### Transcript



**Zee Spencer:** How long have you been programming, Amber?

**Amber Conville:** Professionally or...Actually I don't remember how long I've
been doing it, professionally. *laughs* for I think over five
years, around there five.

**Zee:** That's some time. Allegedly, it's 10,000 hours until you're
a master person in anything or what not. That's about half of
10,000 hours.

**Amber:** I would bet that.

**Zee:** So, you're halfway to mastery. What got you into it? Why did
you decide that you wanted to be a programmer?

**Amber:** Professionally? *laughs*

**Zee:** *laughs*  Yes, professionally.

**Amber:** I always did programming for fun, not like anything
advanced, obviously, or anything awesome. I always thought if I did
that for my job, then it would get boring, and I wouldn't want to
do it anymore.

I would have jobs like, I worked at a grocery store, where I
was the sign maker. It was a lot of template making, it was a
little bit of like graphic design, creative stuff, but it was
mostly just doing same thing over and over again. So I wrote
applications to do that for me.


I managed a brewery once, I was upset with the amount of
paper and the number of binders that they had, so I wrote a system
of really rudimentary database applications to use instead. I
decided I probably should just be a programmer.

**Zee:** *laughs*  So you had these existing business problems, so you
were like, "Ah man, all this paper. That's so annoying," and you
were like, "Screw paper! I'm going to write my own system." Then,
you just did it?

**Amber:** Yeah.

**Zee:** How did you know how to do that? Was it like stuff that
you've done since you were a child? What went on there?

**Amber:** In high school, I did the calculator programming stuff, then
that turned into me taking programming classes in high school. I
knew like the basics of programming, and that kind of stuff.

They happened to have FileMaker for some reason, like at
that particular place, they had FileMaker, I was like all right,
I'll learn how to use this. Awesome, it's like drag and drop
programming. *laughs* I just did that.

**Zee:** You had some training when you were in school, then the
right tools were in the right spot and the right problem
presented itself. I'll just do that. That's the best way ever.

What were those school, were the classes, you said there was
a calculator programming one, and was there other classes too that
were more focused on computer programming? I guess computers are
calculators...

**Amber:** The calculator, that wasn't a class. It was just a thing to
do. *laughs* Like math, if I didn't want to remember calculations, I
would just write applications, like TI89 or whatever, have apps
that do it for me. I know they weren't apps, functions, whatever,
but to do it for me.

I have a little sister who's about five years younger than I
am, and I used to play Drug Wars on my calculator all the time, and
my mom found my sister, playing them and she got really mad. I
found it and I completely reprogrammed all the stuff in it, so that
it was like Banana Wars, it was gorillas gangs and stuff.

**Zee:** That's amazing.

**Amber:** The classes were all true Basic, C++, might have had a HTML one.

**Zee:** That's really cool. The school system supported what you
were doing and they actually provided you some classes. Your mom
gave you a problem. "You can't have this no more," laid down the
gauntlet. "Screw you mom, I'm going to like do this, you can't
stop me."

That's really cool. It's a bummer, that I very rarely see a
lot of schools these days that have like HTML or programming in
Basic or anything.

**Amber:** I don't know why they wouldn't.

**Zee:** Something about not being accredited anymore. You can't get
credits for math or science by teaching programming for high
schools.

**Amber:** When I went, I had like a ton of math credits, so my senior
year I just took all the programming classes. *laughs*

**Zee:** So you got lucky.

**Amber:** Yeah.

**Zee:** Apparently, there's a couple states that still allow you to
get math and science credits for programming, but not a whole lot.
So you've had this junior, like this young...You started out very
early, and then you went, "OK, fine. I'm going to go pro" and now
you're actually like working professionally and have been for the
past five years. Is there any people who really stood out as
helping you make it I guess and do that?

**Amber:** Oh, yeah. There's been a ton of people. I guess how I
actually got to be a professional programmer, since I didn't go to
college for it or anything was Menlo Innovations. In Ann Arbor. 
They do like an extreme interviewing thing and they
hire people based on kindergarten skills, and everybody's a sub
contractor, so it's not like a crazy high paying thing, and you
have to know all this stuff and it's like client services, but it's
all in house.

They interview like 50 people at once and engineering skills and
all kinds of stuff. I didn't know what any of that was then. I
didn't know JAVA or anything but they hired me and taught
me java because I was good at being a kindergartner.


There were people like David Phelps, who unfortunately is past
now, but Rob Meyer, Rob Murdoc, basically all the
people that work at Menlo or how I got to be any good at what I do
now. You know, and later job sites Magnus Star of course, and James
Hood, Adam Martin, Rich Dammkoehler, basically everyone.

**Zee:** That was like a list of 12 people throughout your life for
like the past five-ish years.

**Amber:** I stopped at one point, I could keep going. Like Justin
Smalls, and Mark Davidson, and who do I work with now, 
Tim Taylor, Nathan Hughes and everyone.

**Zee:** It seems like you've got this pattern of like finding
people, learning from them, and just like absorbing whatever you
can. Like if you're in a situation, you're just going to be like,
"I will find at least one, possibly 17 people and learn all I can from them."

**Amber:** Yes. That's actually one of my passions right now, is
community because being able to do that and having access to
people who are good at what they do, everyone I've interacted with
for the last 12 years, I would not be able to do any of the
programming I do right now, or the community events that I do right
now without those people. That's like a huge deal with me, is being
able to organize places where people can get together and mentor or
learn from others.

**Zee:** Could you talk a little bit more about that? What are some
of the things that you're putting together?

**Amber:** Actually for the past couple of years, I've run a group
called Craftsmen Guild, and it's based loosely, and you can tell by the
name, on software craftsmanship so it's about clean code and learning
testing and those sorts of things. We've moved it in to the
learning new things place because when you learn testing, at
some point you turn into *inaudible*.
Craftsmen Guild happens monthly and last week  we did
a mini code retreat because it's only two hours long, and
we did three half an hour sessions with retros and a proper
organizer and everything, next month we're actually going to have
somebody come in and talk about programming for robots.


They're going to bring lego robots, and having the
interface with hardware and the kinds of abstraction layers and
test driving methods you can use to make that easier on your life.
I also help with conference organizing, so I helped a little bit
with 1DevDay this last one, and I'm helping organize Mobi Dev
Day this next one, which is on May 4. Are you going to be around
for that?

**Zee:** Probably not. I'm in San Francisco until the 22nd of April,
or 24th of April.

**Amber:** May 4 though. That's after that.

**Zee:** Let me think about it.

**Amber:** OK. *laughs*

**Zee:** It's Mobi Dev Day Detroit?

**Amber:** Yeah. Mobi Dev Day Detroit and that's the website,
mobidevdaydetroit.com.

**Zee:** I can probably do that. I've got a place I can crash that
night, or the day before, so I'll see you at Mobi DevDay

**Amber:** That'll be awesome, but then I also run two non programming
community educational groups there called Nerd Night, which I was
talking about before. Nerd Night Ann Arbor and Nerd Night Detroit , and that's
just getting together and learning a bunch of stuff.

**Zee:** Could you explain what Nerd Night is because unfortunately I
did not record that part of the audio.

**Amber:** Sure, no problem. Nerd Night is usually three presenters. A
nerd as we choose not define it. It's not like one of those weird
things where everybody says that you're a fake nerd or a real nerd
or whatever. It's just like somebody who is super passionate and
has done a lot of learning in a particular area.

For example, we had somebody come talk about nano
particles. She has been studying nano particles for years. She
loves them. She's crazy about them. She is a nano particle nerd.


It's basically three 18 to 21 minute presentations, and
then there's about 10 minutes for Q and A time. We do three of
those, and we do it at a bar where there's lots of good drinks, and
that's about it.

**Zee:** You organize two or three regular meet up groups, you help
out with conferences, you work, I'm assuming, a regular eight hour
day, you have 17 dogs, which you keep alive and take care of...

**Amber:** *laughs*  My husband helps with that.

**Zee:** Do you sleep at all, or is that one of those things that
you've given up on?

**Amber:** It's actually, like this last week everything, it's like
the perfect time where all things...Usually the Venn diagram is
enough apart that it's not that stressful, but this past week it
was all over lapping, and so it was one of those things, "I should
not have slept a full eight hours. I have stuff to do." *laughs*
"Oh, crap. I slept in."
Or like I went out for a...Nathan Hughes had a comedy show. It was
really good, and we went out afterwards and had a couple drinks,
and in the morning I was like, "I don't have time to do this
stuff." *laughs* "I need to automate so much more of what I'm doing
right now so that I can do those things."

**Zee:** It seems like you got a lot on your plate. I'm so glad you
are taking the time to share your story and some of the things
you're doing.

**Amber:** I don't mind at all.

**Zee:** What do you really love about being a programmer?
Obviously, a part of it must be community, otherwise you wouldn't
be doing all the things you're doing, but is there anything else
you really like?

**Amber:** Yeah. I love problem solving. Actually, that's the right
way to say how I got into programming. I've always solved puzzles.
it's like that feeling you get when you figure out
something that you've been working on for three hours, that might
be really stupid, or it might be really cool and nobody else has
thought of how to do it, and you're just like, "Yes. That worked."
Or being able to bend the world to your world because everything's electronic
now. So like the first time I wrote a mobile app and something
worked on it I was like, "Yeah. That's awesome. I made that thing
on a phone." *laughs*

**Zee:** Yeah, it's like you get this huge dopamine rush. Your brain
gets flooded with all these great chemicals, and you're like "Oh
man, this is amazing," and the four to five hours that you beat
your head against the wall just becomes so worth it because you've
got that hit.

Would you say you're addicted to programming, on a chemical
dependence on that drug?

**Amber:** Yes. If I have too many meetings , I turn into the
hulk.

**Zee:** That would both be terrifying and amazing at the same time.

**Amber:** Yeah. Stuff happens. I start getting mad, I stop paying
attention, I demand food, or I just start programming which is also
not OK with the clients . *laughs*

**Zee:** Where do you want to go? You're doing this awesome
community stuff, you do this great consulting work as writing
mobile and web apps and that kind of stuff. Where do you see
yourself heading?

**Amber:** I have no Idea. I don't have a plan.

**Zee:** "There is no plan. I'm just a programmer chasing apps. I
have no idea what to do when I get one."

**Amber:** I'll tell you where I'm going to be in
five years in about four and a half years. Maybe five years. I
don't know what I'm doing in six months.

**Zee:** That's reasonable. Is there any where you want to go? Are
you happy where you are? You're like "I could do this forever," or
do you have some hidden ambition, or not hidden necessarily?

**Amber:** I'm at Detroit Labs right now, and what makes it the most
fun besides working with a group of extremely talented and awesome
people, actually also in a completely flat hierarchy which is
amazing, like a lot of companies will call themselves flat but not
actually be, Detroit Labs actually is and that's so fun and
awesome.
One of the really fun things about it is that in mobile, not a lot
of people are doing the things they're doing. They don't do
refactoring, they don't do testing,
they think that, "I just wrote this app, and now I shipped it and I
don't need to look at it anymore." Invariably, they'll look at it
again, or I have to look at it later because something is wrong
with it.


One of the things that I really like being a part of right
now is developing the same sorts of things that were going to be in
the web app world, or the desktop world to make programming good
and fun and easy and feel like a work of art again, I like applying
that to mobile.

So finding testing tricking for objective C for example, and it can
be as easy as a java web app or something like that, or helping 
out with mobile views, which actually  I haven't gotten a chance 
to be a huge part of but Detroit Labs has been making huge 
strides over the past few months and it's It's like really exciting 
to be a part of that. That'swhat I'm doing right now.

**Zee:** So that's really cool. You're taking your taking your
background, which is in java and clean code and software
craftsmanship and that kind of stuff, and you're applying it to
this new world of mobile that's...We've been doing for three or
four years now, but it's still a baby industry. I suppose if you
want to go all the way back to like mobile web apps. Is that what
they're called? X-Something?
Anyway, there's been like this html standard that was just for mobile, 
and that was back in the old days with Palm
Pilots and stuff like that, but it's still like a very infantile
industry. Like people don't know how to do the interaction design,
they don't know how to write the code very well. Like it's very...

**Amber:** Isn't that weird?

**Zee:** I know, right?

**Amber:** Because it's not that different. *laughs*

**Zee:** I know. It's like we forget everything as soon as we get
into this new world. It's so sad.

**Amber:** All the lessons go away. Honestly, I think it's because
it's new and it's fun you're just burning through cool stuff really
fast.

**Zee:** Yeah. I can understand that.

**Amber:** Eventually you'll have to refactor.

**Zee:** They're like, "Yeah, the old rules don't apply any more
man. I don't need to extract methods. What do you mean 10,000 lines
is too big for a file?"

**Amber:** That sounds perfect. One of my favorite things I've been
doing lately as I join a project, being like, "You've got tremendously
sized landscape of mountains. Inside this one
method." You know, like a lot of indentation and a lot of
annotation and nested things all the way out. It's like, if you can
make ASCII art out of it, don't do that. *laughs* Extract it.

**Zee:** I now want to start ASCII art programming where all
of my stuff...Actually, have you seen Steve Klabnik's Emoji
language? It's like brainfuck or white space, but it uses Emoji
instead of white space characters or brackets and pipes.

**Amber:** Yeah? I'm going to look that up after this. *laughs*

**Zee:** Anyway, is there anything else you want to say? Any shout
outs you want to make? Any, "Oh my goodness, I'm hiring please come
work with me and the people at Detroit Labs" or anything like that?

**Amber:** I think Detroit Labs is always accepting applications. We
don't really do like the on demand thing, which is another thing I
love about Detroit Labs. Too much work comes in, and we actually
turn some of it away. It's like, "Everyone is working on the
weekend" or whatever. Or if somebody comes and wants to do step up,
we're like, "we don't do that." *laughs* I love that.

I think we're always accepting. We don't take resumes or
anything. You just have to send us an email, and we actually have a
different, nontraditional kind of interviewing process. Yeah,
MobiDev on May 4th. That will be fun and awesome, and I'm
organizing it. Everybody should come to it.

**Zee:** If you're in the Midwest on May 4th, or even if you're not,
and you want to learn how to actually build mobile apps and not
have them suck, I would strongly recommend going to MobiDevDay in
Detroit. It sounds like it's going to be awesome. I'll drive the
four hours or whatever it is from Cleveland and make sure that
happens.

Thank you for your time, Amber. I hope you have a wonderful
week.

**Amber:** Thanks, you too.
